By analyzing your sleep over a month, your Sleep Profile helps you understand and act on long-term sleeping behaviors. You’ll need to log at least 14 nights per month to receive a Sleep Profile on the 1st of each month.
This feature will require a Premium membership.
Your sleep animal is an illustration of your sleep behaviors. You’ll be matched with the sleep animal that most closely reflects your monthly sleep metrics, so you can get an insight into your sleep.
Your sleep animal changes with your sleep metrics, helping you understand the differences in your long-term sleep patterns and trends.
This feature provides your sleep animal, which includes:
- creation_date: The date when your sleep animal was created.
- sleep_type: One of the 6 sleep animals - Giraffe, Tortoise, Dolphin, Hedgehog, Parrot, Bear.
Monthly Sleep Analysis: Your Monthly Sleep Analysis is calculated within your Sleep Profile, and offer a more detailed look at the factors that Fitbit uses to assess your sleep:
- deep_sleep: (minutes) During deep sleep, you’re typically very still and your heart rate variability peaks. Because sleep is a time for rest and recovery, a night without much movement is likely more refreshing. However, sleeping too soundly may be an indication that you’re not getting enough quality sleep.
- rem_sleep: (percent) Rapid-eye-movement sleep, or REM, is an essential sleep stage. You’re likely to have vivid dreams during REM, as your brain is believed to be working hard on complex problems and processing emotions. When you have a lot on your mind, you might find yourself spending too much time in REM sleep.
- sleep_duration: (hours) Sleep duration measures how much sleep you get on average. This may be less than the total amount of time you spend in bed. While everyone has different sleep needs, consistently getting the right amount for your body is important to feel well rested.
- sleep_start_time: (time) This metric tracks the time you usually get to sleep. While some people prefer to sleep earlier, and others later, it’s most important to have a consistent schedule. Aligning this to your daily routine is key to good sleep hygiene.
- schedule_variability: (hours) This shows how much your sleep schedule varies from day to day. Your body clock plays a key role in your mental and physical wellbeing. An inconsistent sleep schedule can affect this natural rhythm and stop you from feeling your best.
- restorative_sleep: (score 0-100) Restorative sleep measures how much of your time asleep is spent with your heart rate lower than your usual resting rate. Many aspects of restful and restorative sleep are associated with a lower heart rate.
- time_before_sound_sleep: (minutes) This tracks how long it usually takes you to fall soundly asleep. Regularly falling asleep without significant delay is a sign your body is sleeping at a time that lines up with your schedule.
- sleep_stability: (wake counts per hour) As you change sleep stages or your sleeping position, your brain often wakes up for a moment, but it’s usually so brief you don’t notice. Stability tracks how often this happens. If you notice changes in your sleep stability, it might be time to look into your sleep environment.
- nights_with_long_awakenings: (percent of nights with long awakenings) Noise, light, or an overactive mind might wake you up and keep you up for a while. Most people have occasional long awakenings, but if you notice them becoming more common, it’s a good idea to look into the cause.
- days_with_naps: (percent of days with naps) This measures naps detected using Fitbit. Naps may be necessary after a bad night’s sleep, and can help you feel more refreshed. But if you find you’re napping often, it could be a sign of other factors affecting your long-term sleep.
